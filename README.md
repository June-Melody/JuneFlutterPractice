# Legos
Here are some Legos that can easily be integrated with lego-flutter.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [**logger.log_flutter**](https://github.com/melodysdreamj/logger.lego-flutter) | Logger is one of the famous log packages in the Flutter community. When you use this package, the location of the logo printed in the console window comes out to the depth you set, making it very easy to use for debugging and more. In this Lego, we've wrapped logger one more time to make it even easier to use.
| [**battery_plus.log_flutter**](https://github.com/melodysdreamj/logger.lego-flutter) | Battery_plus is one of the most famous packages related to batteries.
